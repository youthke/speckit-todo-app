## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What signup method(s) should be supported? ‚Üí A: Google OAuth signup only

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A new user visits the application and wants to create an account to access the todo management features. They navigate to the signup page, click "Sign up with Google," authorize the application through Google's authentication, and successfully create an account that allows them to access the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user on the signup page, **When** they click "Sign up with Google" and complete Google authorization, **Then** their account is created, they are automatically logged in, and redirected to the main application
2. **Given** a user with an existing Google-linked account, **When** they attempt to sign up again with the same Google account, **Then** they are automatically logged in and redirected to the main application
3. **Given** a user on the signup page, **When** they cancel or deny Google authorization, **Then** they remain on the signup page with the option to retry
4. **Given** a user who has successfully signed up via Google, **When** they are redirected to the main application, **Then** they have immediate access to all protected features without additional authentication
5. **Given** a user on the signup page, **When** they want to switch to login instead, **Then** they can navigate to the login page
6. **Given** an IP address that has exceeded the rate limit, **When** a user attempts to sign up, **Then** they receive an error message indicating too many attempts and must wait before retrying

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to signup with a Google account that already exists in the system? (Answer: automatically logged in)
- What happens if Google authorization fails or times out?
- What happens if the user loses connection during Google OAuth flow?
- What happens when Google does not provide an email address (signup must fail)?
- What happens when Google provides email but no name or profile picture (signup proceeds with email only)?
- What happens when an IP address exceeds rate limit for signup attempts? (User receives error and must wait)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow new users to create an account using Google OAuth authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST require email address from Google to complete signup (signup fails if email not provided)
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect when a Google account is already registered and automatically log the user in instead of creating a duplicate account
- **FR-004**: System MUST store user account information securely (email required; name, profile picture, and Google account identifier optional)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages when Google authorization fails, is denied, or does not provide required email
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to navigate between signup and login pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically log users in after successful signup or existing account detection and redirect them to the main application
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply rate limiting to signup attempts per IP address to prevent abuse

### Key Entities
- **User Account**: Represents a registered user in the system; includes email address (required), account creation timestamp, and authentication status; optionally includes name, profile picture URL, and Google account identifier if provided by Google
- **Google Profile Data**: Information received from Google OAuth; email is required for signup; name, profile picture URL, and unique Google identifier are optional
