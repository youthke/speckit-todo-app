# Feature Specification: Google Account Login

**Feature Branch**: `005-google`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "„É¶„Éº„Ç∂„Éº„ÅØGoogle„Ç¢„Ç´„Ç¶„É≥„Éà„ÇíÁî®„ÅÑ„Å¶„É≠„Ç∞„Ç§„É≥„Åô„Çã„Åì„Å®„Åå„Åß„Åç„Çã„ÄÇ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What Google OAuth scopes should the application request? ‚Üí A: Standard: Email, basic profile, plus Google account ID for reliable linking
- Q: How should the system handle existing users who already have an account with the same email but used a different authentication method? ‚Üí A: Automatic merge: Link Google auth to existing account seamlessly
- Q: How long should user authentication sessions remain active? ‚Üí A: Standard: 24 hours with auto-refresh if user is active
- Q: What should happen when Google's authentication service is unavailable? ‚Üí A: Block completely: Show error, require Google service to be working
- Q: How should the system handle users who revoke application access from their Google account settings after successful authentication? ‚Üí A: Immediate logout: Detect revocation and end session immediately

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the todo application and wants to log in using their existing Google account credentials. They click a "Sign in with Google" option, are redirected to Google's authentication service, grant permission to the application, and are returned to the todo app as an authenticated user with access to their personal data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a valid Google account, **When** they click "Sign in with Google" and complete Google's authentication flow, **Then** they are logged into the todo application and can access their personal todo items
2. **Given** a user is already signed into Google in their browser, **When** they choose to sign in with Google, **Then** the authentication process is streamlined without requiring additional credential entry
3. **Given** a user cancels the Google authentication process, **When** they are redirected back to the application, **Then** they remain on the login page with an appropriate message
4. **Given** a user's Google account lacks required permissions, **When** they attempt to authenticate, **Then** they receive a clear error message explaining the issue

### Edge Cases
- When Google's authentication service is temporarily unavailable, system displays clear error message and requires service availability for login attempts
- When users revoke application access from their Google account settings, system detects revocation and immediately ends their session
- What occurs if a user's Google account is suspended or deleted after initial authentication?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Sign in with Google" option on the login interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect users to Google's OAuth authorization service when they choose Google login
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle the OAuth callback from Google and exchange authorization codes for access tokens
- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve basic user profile information from Google (name, email) upon successful authentication
- **FR-005**: System MUST create or link user accounts based on Google email addresses
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain user session state for 24 hours with automatic refresh during active use
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide appropriate error handling for failed authentication attempts
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect user privacy and only request standard Google OAuth scopes (email, basic profile, and Google account ID)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle cases where users deny permission during the Google authorization flow
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically link Google authentication to existing accounts with matching email addresses
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect when users revoke application access and immediately terminate their session

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents a user in the system, linked to Google account identifier, includes email, display name, and authentication metadata
- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active user session with 24-hour expiration time, automatic refresh capability, and session tokens
- **OAuth Token**: Stores Google access/refresh tokens for maintaining authentication state
