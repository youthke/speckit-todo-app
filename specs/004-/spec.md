## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description: "Adopt Domain-Driven Design principles in the backend"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Backend developers, Domain experts
   ‚Üí Actions: Restructure code, implement DDD patterns
   ‚Üí Data: Domain models, business logic
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must maintain existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific DDD patterns to implement]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Migration strategy for existing code]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Scope of refactoring - full rewrite or gradual]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: Developer working with domain-focused code structure
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on code organization and maintainability
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Domain models, aggregates, services
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties requiring clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarification)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What specific domains should be established in the todo application for clear bounded contexts? ‚Üí A: Two domains: Task Management + User Management
- Q: What DDD architectural layers should be implemented in the backend structure? ‚Üí A: Four layers: Domain + Application + Infrastructure + Presentation
- Q: What migration approach should be used for implementing DDD in the existing codebase? ‚Üí A: Big bang rewrite: Complete restructure to DDD architecture in one phase
- Q: What repository pattern approach should be implemented for data access? ‚Üí A: Pure DDD repositories: Domain-focused interfaces with infrastructure implementations
- Q: What specific DDD patterns should be prioritized for implementation? ‚Üí A: Core patterns: Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a backend developer working on the todo application, I need the codebase to be organized using Domain-Driven Design principles so that business logic is clearly separated from infrastructure concerns, making the code more maintainable and aligned with business requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing backend codebase, **When** a developer needs to add new business functionality, **Then** they can easily identify where domain logic belongs and add it without affecting unrelated components
2. **Given** domain models in the system, **When** business rules change, **Then** developers can modify the appropriate domain entities without impacting data access or presentation layers
3. **Given** a DDD-structured backend, **When** new team members join the project, **Then** they can quickly understand the business domain by examining the domain layer

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing functionality needs to be preserved during the DDD migration?
- How does the system handle complex business transactions that span multiple domain boundaries?
- What happens when domain experts need to review business logic implementation?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement core DDD patterns: Entities (with identity and behavior), Value Objects (immutable data), Aggregates (consistency boundaries), and Domain Services (business operations spanning multiple entities)
- **FR-002**: System MUST separate domain logic from infrastructure concerns such as database access and external API calls
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement domain services for business operations that don't naturally belong to a single entity
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain clear boundaries between the Task Management domain (todo items, categories, completion status) and User Management domain (authentication, user profiles, preferences)
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality during the complete architectural restructure to DDD patterns
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement pure DDD repository patterns with domain-focused interfaces defined in the domain layer and concrete implementations in the infrastructure layer
- **FR-007**: System MUST organize code in four distinct layers: Domain layer (entities, value objects, domain services), Application layer (use cases, application services), Infrastructure layer (repositories, external services), and Presentation layer (API controllers, request/response models)

### Key Entities
- **Domain Models**: Core business entities representing todo items, users, and other business concepts with their invariants and business rules
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of related entities and value objects that maintain consistency boundaries
- **Domain Services**: Services that encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally fit within a single entity
- **Repositories**: Interfaces for data access that abstract persistence details from the domain layer
- **Application Services**: Orchestration layer that coordinates domain operations and handles cross-cutting concerns
