# Research: Backend Domain-Driven Design Implementation

**Feature**: Backend Domain-Driven Design Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### Go DDD Implementation Patterns

**Decision**: Use Go's interface-based dependency injection for repository patterns
**Rationale**: Go's implicit interfaces make it easy to define domain interfaces and provide infrastructure implementations without circular dependencies
**Alternatives considered**:
- Dependency injection frameworks (go-wire, uber/dig) - rejected as overcomplicated for this scope
- Direct struct embedding - rejected as it violates DDD layering principles

### Directory Structure for DDD in Go

**Decision**: Layer-first organization with domain contexts as subdirectories
**Rationale**: Clear separation of architectural concerns while maintaining bounded context isolation
**Alternatives considered**:
- Context-first organization (domain/task/, domain/user/ at root) - rejected as it makes layer boundaries unclear
- Single domain package - rejected as it violates bounded context principles

### Repository Pattern Implementation

**Decision**: Interface definitions in domain layer, implementations in infrastructure layer
**Rationale**: Follows pure DDD principles with dependency inversion, makes testing easier
**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic repository pattern - rejected as specified in clarifications
- Active Record pattern - rejected as it mixes domain logic with persistence

### Entity and Aggregate Design

**Decision**: Use Go structs with methods for entities, separate ID types for strong typing
**Rationale**: Go's struct methods provide clear behavior attachment, typed IDs prevent mixing entity types
**Alternatives considered**:
- Interface-based entities - rejected as Go structs are more idiomatic
- String/int IDs - rejected as they don't provide type safety

### Value Objects Implementation

**Decision**: Immutable Go structs with validation in constructors
**Rationale**: Go's value semantics naturally support immutability, constructor validation ensures invariants
**Alternatives considered**:
- Mutable structs with setter validation - rejected as it violates value object principles
- Interface-based value objects - rejected as unnecessary abstraction

### Domain Services Pattern

**Decision**: Stateless services with domain logic that doesn't belong to single entities
**Rationale**: Clear separation of multi-entity business operations
**Alternatives considered**:
- Adding complex logic to entities - rejected as it violates single responsibility
- Application service handling - rejected as it mixes layers

### Migration Strategy Research

**Decision**: Big bang rewrite with feature parity validation
**Rationale**: Clean slate approach ensures proper DDD implementation without compromises
**Alternatives considered**:
- Strangler fig pattern - rejected based on clarification preference
- Gradual refactoring - rejected based on clarification preference

### Testing Strategy for DDD

**Decision**: Layer-specific test strategies with contract tests between layers
**Rationale**: Each layer has different testing needs and dependencies
**Testing approach**:
- Domain layer: Pure unit tests with no external dependencies
- Application layer: Service tests with mock repositories
- Infrastructure layer: Integration tests with real databases
- Presentation layer: Contract tests for API compliance

### Go-Specific DDD Considerations

**Decision**: Use Go modules for each layer to enforce dependency rules
**Rationale**: Compile-time enforcement of architectural boundaries
**Implementation notes**:
- Domain layer cannot import application/infrastructure/presentation
- Application layer can import domain but not infrastructure/presentation
- Infrastructure layer can import domain and application
- Presentation layer can import all layers

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Component | Technology Choice | Key Reason |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Entities | Go structs with methods | Idiomatic Go, clear behavior attachment |
| Value Objects | Immutable structs with constructors | Natural immutability, validation |
| Repositories | Interface in domain, impl in infra | Dependency inversion, testability |
| Services | Stateless Go services | Clear responsibility separation |
| Aggregates | Root entity with contained objects | Consistency boundary enforcement |
| Migration | Big bang rewrite | Clean DDD implementation |
| Testing | Layer-specific strategies | Appropriate test boundaries |
| Dependency Management | Go interfaces | Implicit interface satisfaction |

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during rewrite
  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration tests before migration, API contract preservation

- **Risk**: Over-engineering with DDD patterns
  **Mitigation**: Focus on core patterns only (Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services)

- **Risk**: Performance degradation from additional layers
  **Mitigation**: Benchmark existing performance, optimize hot paths in infrastructure layer

## Next Steps

1. Design domain models based on existing task/user functionality
2. Define repository interfaces for persistence needs
3. Create API contracts that preserve existing endpoints
4. Generate comprehensive test suite for validation
