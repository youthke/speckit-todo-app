# Feature Specification: Frontend TypeScript Migration

**Feature Branch**: `003-frontend-typescript`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "frontend„ÇíTypeScript„Å´„Åó„Åü„ÅÑ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the todo application, I want the frontend codebase to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript so that I can catch type errors at compile time, improve code maintainability, and enhance the development experience with better IDE support and autocompletion.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a React frontend currently written in JavaScript, **When** the migration is complete, **Then** all frontend code should be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. **Given** the migrated TypeScript frontend, **When** a developer makes a type error, **Then** the error should be caught at compile time before runtime
3. **Given** the migrated codebase, **When** a developer opens the project in their IDE, **Then** they should receive enhanced autocompletion and IntelliSense support
4. **Given** the existing functionality, **When** the migration is complete, **Then** all current features should continue to work exactly as before

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external library types are not available or incomplete?
- How does the system handle gradual migration if done incrementally?
- What happens to existing build processes and development workflows?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST convert all existing JavaScript files (.js, .jsx) to TypeScript equivalents (.ts, .tsx)
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all current application functionality after migration
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide proper type definitions for all components, functions, and data structures
- **FR-004**: System MUST configure TypeScript compiler with appropriate settings for the project
- **FR-005**: System MUST update build processes to handle TypeScript compilation
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all external dependencies have proper type definitions
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that no type errors exist after migration completion
- **FR-008**: Development workflow MUST continue to work seamlessly with TypeScript
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing development tools and processes

### Key Entities
- **Frontend Codebase**: The collection of React components, utilities, and logic currently written in JavaScript that needs TypeScript conversion
- **Type Definitions**: Interfaces, types, and type annotations that describe the shape and behavior of data and functions
- **Build Configuration**: TypeScript compiler settings and build tool configurations needed for compilation
- **Development Environment**: IDE setup and development workflow tools that will benefit from TypeScript integration
