# Research: Frontend TypeScript Migration

## React TypeScript Migration Strategy

### Decision: Incremental Migration Approach
**Rationale**: Minimize risk and allow for gradual type adoption
- Convert files one at a time starting with utilities and working up to components
- Maintain existing functionality throughout the process
- Enable TypeScript compilation alongside JavaScript files

**Alternatives considered**:
- Big-bang migration: Rejected due to high risk of breaking changes
- Parallel TypeScript rewrite: Rejected due to resource requirements and duplication

### Decision: TypeScript Configuration
**Rationale**: Use Create React App's built-in TypeScript support for minimal configuration overhead
- CRA 5.0.1 has native TypeScript support with sensible defaults
- No need for custom webpack configuration
- Automatic type checking in development

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom webpack + TypeScript config: Rejected for complexity
- Separate TypeScript build process: Rejected for development experience impact

### Decision: Type Definition Strategy
**Rationale**: Use explicit typing with gradual adoption of strict types
- Start with any types for complex external library interactions
- Gradually strengthen type definitions as understanding improves
- Use interface definitions for component props and state

**Alternatives considered**:
- Strict typing from start: Rejected for migration complexity
- Minimal typing (mostly any): Rejected for missing type safety benefits

## TypeScript Dependencies

### Decision: @types packages for existing dependencies
**Rationale**: Provide type definitions for React ecosystem
- @types/react and @types/react-dom for React types
- @types/jest for testing types
- @types/node for Node.js types in build scripts

**Alternatives considered**:
- Skip type definitions: Rejected for losing type safety benefits
- Manual type declarations: Rejected for maintenance overhead

## File Extension Strategy

### Decision: .tsx for React components, .ts for utilities
**Rationale**: Follow TypeScript conventions
- .tsx for files containing JSX
- .ts for pure TypeScript files without JSX
- Maintain existing file organization and naming

**Alternatives considered**:
- All .ts extensions: Rejected due to JSX compilation requirements
- Mixed approach: Rejected for consistency

## Development Workflow Impact

### Decision: Maintain existing npm scripts
**Rationale**: Zero disruption to development workflow
- `npm start` continues to work with TypeScript files
- `npm test` automatically picks up TypeScript test files
- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript to JavaScript

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate TypeScript build commands: Rejected for workflow complexity
- Additional linting steps: Deferred to future enhancement

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Convert test files to TypeScript gradually
**Rationale**: Maintain test coverage throughout migration
- Convert test files after their corresponding source files
- Use typed testing utilities for better test safety
- Maintain existing test structure and naming

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep tests in JavaScript: Rejected for inconsistent type safety
- Rewrite all tests: Rejected for scope creep
