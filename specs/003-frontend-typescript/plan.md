# Implementation Plan: Frontend TypeScript Migration

**Branch**: `003-frontend-typescript` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-frontend-typescript/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Migrate the existing React frontend from JavaScript to TypeScript to improve type safety, development experience, and code maintainability. The frontend currently uses React 19.1.1 with Create React App 5.0.1 and contains components, forms, and test files that need TypeScript conversion.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (migration from JavaScript ES6+)
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19.1.1, React Scripts 5.0.1, Testing Library, Axios
**Storage**: N/A (frontend-only migration)
**Testing**: React Testing Library, Jest (via react-scripts)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers, Create React App build system
**Project Type**: web - frontend component of web application
**Performance Goals**: No degradation from current performance, maintain hot reload development experience
**Constraints**: Must maintain all existing functionality, preserve current build process, zero downtime migration
**Scale/Scope**: Small-medium React app with components, forms, and tests (~10-20 source files)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Constitution Check**: PASS
- This is a migration/refactoring task with clear scope
- No new external dependencies beyond TypeScript tooling
- Maintains existing architecture and patterns
- Follows incremental migration best practices
- No constitutional violations identified

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with separate backend and frontend directories. This migration focuses only on the frontend/ directory, converting all .js/.jsx files to .ts/.tsx while maintaining the existing component and folder structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- TypeScript setup and configuration tasks
- File-by-file migration tasks in dependency order
- Type definition and interface creation tasks
- Testing and validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup first: TypeScript dependencies and configuration
- Dependency order: Types → API layer → Components → Tests
- Incremental approach: One file at a time to maintain working state
- Validation after each major milestone

**Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks**: TypeScript installation, tsconfig.json, dependencies
2. **Type Definition Tasks**: Create interfaces, API contracts, component props
3. **Migration Tasks**: Convert .js/.jsx files to .ts/.tsx in dependency order
4. **Integration Tasks**: Update imports, fix type errors, verify functionality
5. **Validation Tasks**: Build verification, testing, performance checks

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
