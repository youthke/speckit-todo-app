**Feature Branch**: `007-google`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "„É¶„Éº„Ç∂„Éº„ÅØGoogle„Ç¢„Ç´„Ç¶„É≥„Éà„ÇíÁî®„ÅÑ„Å¶„Çµ„Ç§„É≥„Ç¢„ÉÉ„Éó„Åß„Åç„Çã"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: When an existing user with a Google-linked account attempts to sign up again using the same Google account, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Redirect user to login page automatically
- Q: Which user profile data should be extracted and stored from Google during signup? ‚Üí A: Email address only
- Q: When a user authenticates with Google but Google denies permission or an error occurs, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Return to signup page with generic error message "Authentication failed"
- Q: After a user successfully signs up with Google, what session management behavior is required? ‚Üí A: User is automatically logged in with session lasting 7 days
- Q: Should the system require that the Google account email is verified before allowing signup? ‚Üí A: Yes, reject signup if Google email is not verified

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new user visits the todo-app and wants to create an account using their existing Google account credentials instead of creating a new username and password. They click on a "Sign up with Google" button, are redirected to Google's authentication page, grant permissions, and are returned to the todo-app with a newly created account linked to their Google identity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the signup page, **When** they click "Sign up with Google" and successfully authenticate with Google, **Then** a new user account is created and they are logged into the application
2. **Given** an existing user with a Google-linked account, **When** they attempt to sign up again with the same Google account, **Then** the system redirects them to the login page
3. **Given** a user clicks "Sign up with Google", **When** they cancel the Google authentication flow, **Then** they are returned to the signup page without an account being created
4. **Given** a user authenticates with Google, **When** Google denies permission or an error occurs, **Then** the system returns the user to the signup page with the error message "Authentication failed"
5. **Given** a user authenticates with Google, **When** the Google account email is not verified, **Then** the system rejects the signup and returns to the signup page with "Authentication failed" message

### Edge Cases
- When Google authentication times out or network fails during the OAuth flow, user is returned to signup page with "Authentication failed" message
- How does the system handle users who revoke Google app permissions after signup?
- What happens if a user's Google account is deleted or suspended after they've signed up?
- Should users be able to link multiple Google accounts to one todo-app account?
- Can users who signed up with Google also set a traditional password?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initiate signup using their Google account credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect users to Google's authentication page during signup flow
- **FR-003**: System MUST create a new user account upon successful Google authentication for first-time users
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract and store the email address from the Google account
- **FR-005**: System MUST link the Google account identifier to the user's todo-app account
- **FR-006**: System MUST return users to the signup page with the generic error message "Authentication failed" when Google authentication fails or permission is denied
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that the Google account email is verified and reject signup if the email is not verified
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect when a Google account already has an associated user account and redirect to the login page instead of creating a duplicate account
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to access their account after successful Google signup without additional registration steps
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically log in the user after successful Google signup and create a session that remains valid for 7 days
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data privacy compliance - GDPR, user consent for data storage?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear feedback during the signup process [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific UI/UX requirements?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents a todo-app user, includes unique identifier, creation timestamp, and authentication method indicator
- **Google Identity Link**: Represents the connection between a User Account and a Google account, includes Google user ID and email address
- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active user session after successful signup, includes session identifier, 7-day expiration time, and associated user account
