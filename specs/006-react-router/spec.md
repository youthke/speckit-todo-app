# Feature Specification: React Router Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `006-react-router`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "react-router„ÇíÁî®„ÅÑ„Å¶„É´„Éº„ÉÜ„Ç£„É≥„Ç∞„ÇíË°å„ÅÜ„ÄÇ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request: Implement routing using React Router
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Application users navigating between pages
   ‚Üí Actions: Navigate between different pages/views
   ‚Üí Data: Current application has todo list, auth, login pages
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use React Router library
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which React Router version to use - v6 or v7?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific routes/pages need to be created beyond existing Login, AuthCallback, and main Todo pages?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be protected routes requiring authentication?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should routing handle 404/not found pages?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should navigation history be preserved across sessions?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User can navigate between different pages
   ‚Üí User can use browser back/forward buttons
   ‚Üí User can bookmark and directly access specific pages
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Routes, Pages, Navigation state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - multiple clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: Should unauthenticated users be allowed to access the todo list page, or must they log in first? ‚Üí A: Redirect to login - unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to /login
- Q: How should the system handle navigation to a non-existent route (e.g., /unknown-page)? ‚Üí A: Show 404 page - display a dedicated "Page Not Found" error page
- Q: Should users have visible navigation links/menu to move between pages, or rely only on browser navigation and direct URLs? ‚Üí A: Visible navigation - provide clickable links/menu to navigate between pages
- Q: Should the application support deep linking to individual todo items (e.g., /todos/123)? ‚Üí A: No - only page-level navigation (login, main todo list) is needed
- Q: After a user successfully logs in, where should they be redirected? ‚Üí A: Always go to todo list - always redirect to main todo list page regardless of where they came from

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users need to navigate between different pages of the todo application (login, main todo list, authentication callback) using standard web navigation patterns. Users should be able to use browser navigation buttons, bookmark specific pages, and share links to specific views.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the login page, **When** they successfully authenticate, **Then** they are always navigated to the main todo list page
2. **Given** a user is on the main todo list page, **When** they click the browser back button, **Then** they navigate to the previous page in their history
3. **Given** a user directly enters a page URL in the browser, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the requested page content
4. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they try to access the todo list, **Then** they are automatically redirected to the login page
5. **Given** a user bookmarks a specific page, **When** they return via the bookmark, **Then** they see the same page content
6. **Given** a user navigates to a non-existent URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a "Page Not Found" (404) error page
7. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they click a navigation link, **Then** they are navigated to the corresponding page
8. **Given** an unauthenticated user is redirected to login after attempting to access a protected page, **When** they successfully authenticate, **Then** they are navigated to the main todo list page (not back to the originally attempted page)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user navigates to a non-existent route? System displays a dedicated "Page Not Found" (404) error page.
- How does the system handle navigation during authentication flow (OAuth callback)? Callback URL redirects to main todo list after successful authentication.
- What happens when a user tries to navigate back from the login page? Browser navigates to previous page in history (if any).
- Should the application preserve scroll position when navigating back? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scroll restoration behavior not specified]
- How should the application handle deep linking to specific todo items? Deep linking to individual todo items is out of scope; only page-level navigation is required.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to navigate between distinct pages using URLs
- **FR-002**: System MUST support browser back and forward navigation
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to bookmark and directly access specific pages via URL
- **FR-004**: System MUST display appropriate content based on the current URL path
- **FR-005**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to the login page when they attempt to access the todo list page
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle OAuth callback routing for Google authentication
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a dedicated "Page Not Found" (404) error page when users navigate to non-existent routes
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain navigation history for browser controls
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide visible navigation links or menu allowing users to navigate between available pages
- **FR-010**: System MUST support direct URL access to all public pages
- **FR-011**: System MUST NOT support deep linking to individual todo items (scope limited to page-level navigation only)
- **FR-012**: System MUST always redirect authenticated users to the main todo list page after successful login, regardless of their previous location

### Key Entities
- **Route**: Represents a URL path that maps to a specific page or view in the application
- **Page/View**: Distinct screens users can navigate to (login, main todo list, auth callback, 404 error page)
- **Navigation State**: Current location, history stack, and route parameters
- **Protected Route**: Routes that require authentication before access (e.g., todo list page requires login, redirects to /login if unauthenticated)
- **Navigation Menu**: Visible UI component containing clickable links for navigating between available pages
