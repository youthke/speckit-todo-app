# Tasks: API Health Endpoint Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-api-health/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Go 1.23+, Gin web framework, GORM ORM, SQLite database
   → Structure: backend/ and frontend/ directories (web application)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: HealthStatus entity with validation
   → contracts/health-api.yaml: 1 enhanced GET /health endpoint
   → quickstart.md: 5 core user scenarios + edge cases
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: health models, health service, enhanced endpoint
   → Integration: database connectivity checks
   → Polish: unit tests, performance validation, frontend integration
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Dependencies block execution
5. Validate all contracts/entities/scenarios covered
6. SUCCESS: 12 tasks ready for execution
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- All file paths are absolute from repository root

## Phase 3.1: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.2
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

- [x] T001 [P] Contract test GET /health endpoint in `backend/tests/contract/health_get_test.go`
- [x] T002 [P] Integration test healthy service scenario in `backend/tests/integration/health_healthy_test.go`
- [x] T003 [P] Integration test database connectivity verification in `backend/tests/integration/health_database_test.go`
- [x] T004 [P] Integration test service status monitoring in `backend/tests/integration/health_monitoring_test.go`
- [x] T005 [P] Integration test response time validation in `backend/tests/integration/health_performance_test.go`

## Phase 3.2: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

- [x] T006 Health models with validation in `backend/internal/models/health.go`
- [x] T007 Health service with database connectivity checks in `backend/internal/services/health_service.go`
- [x] T008 Enhanced GET /health endpoint handler in `backend/cmd/server/main.go`

## Phase 3.3: Integration & Polish

- [x] T009 [P] Unit tests for health validation in `backend/tests/unit/health_validation_test.go`
- [x] T010 [P] Edge case tests (database disconnection scenarios) in `backend/tests/unit/health_edge_cases_test.go`
- [x] T011 Performance validation: health endpoint response times <200ms
- [x] T012 [P] Update frontend API service to utilize enhanced health information in `frontend/src/services/api.js`

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies (TDD)
- **Tests (T001-T005) MUST complete and FAIL before implementation (T006-T008)**
- **T006 (models) blocks T007 (service)**
- **T007 (service) blocks T008 (endpoint)**

### Implementation Dependencies
- **T008 requires T006, T007 (endpoint needs models and service)**
- **T009-T010 can run after T006 (unit tests need models)**
- **T011 requires T008 (performance tests need endpoint)**
- **T012 independent (frontend integration)**

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.1 Contract and Integration Tests (T001-T005)
```bash
# Launch all test creation together:
Task: "Contract test GET /health endpoint in backend/tests/contract/health_get_test.go"
Task: "Integration test healthy service scenario in backend/tests/integration/health_healthy_test.go"
Task: "Integration test database connectivity verification in backend/tests/integration/health_database_test.go"
Task: "Integration test service status monitoring in backend/tests/integration/health_monitoring_test.go"
Task: "Integration test response time validation in backend/tests/integration/health_performance_test.go"
```

### Phase 3.3 Unit Tests and Polish (T009-T010, T012)
```bash
# Launch independent polish tasks together:
Task: "Unit tests for health validation in backend/tests/unit/health_validation_test.go"
Task: "Edge case tests (database disconnection scenarios) in backend/tests/unit/health_edge_cases_test.go"
Task: "Update frontend API service to utilize enhanced health information in frontend/src/services/api.js"
```

## Task Generation Rules Applied

### From Contracts (health-api.yaml)
✅ **GET /health** → T001 (contract test) + T008 (implementation)

### From Data Model
✅ **HealthStatus entity** → T006 (models) + T007 (service)

### From Quickstart Scenarios
✅ **Healthy service check** → T002 (integration test)
✅ **Database connectivity verification** → T003 (integration test)
✅ **Service status monitoring** → T004 (integration test)
✅ **Response time validation** → T005 (integration test)
✅ **Edge cases** → T010 (unit tests)

## Validation Checklist ✅

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T001)
- [x] HealthStatus entity has model task (T006)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T001-T005 before T006-T008)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] All quickstart scenarios covered (T002-T005)
- [x] Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints ordering maintained

## Detailed Task Descriptions

### T001: Contract Test GET /health
Create comprehensive contract test validating:
- HTTP 200 response for healthy service
- HTTP 503 response for degraded service
- Response schema matches health-api.yaml
- Required fields (status, database, timestamp)
- Optional fields (version, uptime)
- Proper JSON structure and data types

### T002: Integration Test Healthy Service
Test end-to-end healthy service scenario:
- Start with healthy database connection
- Call /health endpoint
- Verify 200 status and "healthy" response
- Validate all fields present and correct
- Confirm response time <200ms

### T003: Integration Test Database Connectivity
Test database connectivity verification:
- Test with connected database → "connected" status
- Test with disconnected database → "disconnected" status
- Verify service health reflects database state
- Ensure endpoint remains responsive

### T004: Integration Test Service Monitoring
Test monitoring service usage patterns:
- Repeated requests (simulate monitoring polling)
- Verify consistent response structure
- Check timestamp updates correctly
- Ensure no performance degradation

### T005: Integration Test Response Time
Performance validation for monitoring requirements:
- Measure response times under normal load
- Verify <200ms response time consistently
- Test with concurrent requests
- Validate no blocking operations

### T006: Health Models
Create Go structs for health responses:
- HealthStatus struct with validation tags
- HealthResponse struct for API responses
- Validation methods for enum values
- JSON marshaling tags
- Error response structures

### T007: Health Service
Implement health checking business logic:
- Database connectivity testing using GORM
- Service status determination logic
- Timestamp generation (ISO 8601)
- Version information retrieval
- Uptime calculation
- Error handling for edge cases

### T008: Enhanced Health Endpoint
Replace simple health endpoint with enhanced version:
- Use HealthService for status checks
- Return structured HealthResponse JSON
- Proper HTTP status codes (200/503/500)
- Error handling and logging
- Maintain backward compatibility

### T009: Health Validation Unit Tests
Test validation logic in isolation:
- Test enum validation (status, database)
- Test timestamp format validation
- Test version format validation
- Test uptime value validation
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### T010: Health Edge Cases Unit Tests
Test edge case scenarios:
- Database connection timeouts
- Invalid database states
- Service startup conditions
- High load scenarios
- Malformed requests

### T011: Performance Validation
Validate health endpoint performance:
- Response time measurements
- Load testing with ab or similar tool
- Verify <200ms requirement under load
- Check memory usage and CPU impact
- Validate monitoring-friendly performance

### T012: Frontend Integration
Update frontend to use enhanced health information:
- Modify API service health check function
- Handle new response structure
- Display additional health information
- Update error handling for new status codes
- Maintain existing server status functionality

## Notes

- **TDD Enforcement**: Tests T001-T005 must be written first and MUST FAIL
- **File Conflicts**: No parallel tasks modify the same file
- **Dependencies**: Database service (T007) required before endpoint (T008)
- **Performance**: T011 validates <200ms requirement from technical context
- **Edge Cases**: T010 covers database connectivity and startup scenarios
- **Integration**: T012 leverages enhanced health data in frontend
- **Backward Compatibility**: Enhanced endpoint maintains existing behavior
