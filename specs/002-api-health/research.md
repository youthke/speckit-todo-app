# Research: API Health Endpoint Enhancement

**Feature**: Enhanced health endpoint for TODO application
**Research Date**: 2025-09-27

## Research Tasks

### 1. System Information Requirements (FR-008)
**Question**: Should detailed system information like version, uptime be included?

**Decision**: Include basic system information suitable for monitoring
**Rationale**:
- Version information helps track deployment status
- Uptime provides operational insights
- Minimal performance impact
- Standard practice for health endpoints

**Implementation**: Include app version and basic status timestamp

### 2. External Dependencies Check (FR-009)
**Question**: Should it check external dependencies beyond database?

**Decision**: Only database connectivity for initial implementation
**Rationale**:
- TODO app currently only depends on SQLite database
- No external APIs or services to check
- Keeps health check focused and fast
- Can be extended later if new dependencies added

**Implementation**: Check SQLite database connection only

### 3. Error Status Codes (FR-010)
**Question**: What specific error codes should be returned for different failure scenarios?

**Decision**: Standard HTTP status codes with structured response
**Rationale**:
- HTTP 200: All systems healthy
- HTTP 503: Service unavailable (database down)
- HTTP 500: Internal server error (unexpected failures)
- Follows standard health check patterns

**Implementation**:
- 200 OK: {"status": "healthy", "database": "connected", "timestamp": "..."}
- 503 Service Unavailable: {"status": "degraded", "database": "disconnected", "timestamp": "..."}

## Technical Research

### Health Check Best Practices
**Research**: Industry standards for API health endpoints

**Findings**:
- Response time < 200ms is critical for monitoring
- Include timestamp for troubleshooting
- Use consistent JSON structure
- Separate detailed checks from basic liveness
- Avoid exposing sensitive system information

**Application**: Implement lightweight checks with structured JSON response

### Database Connection Testing
**Research**: How to test GORM database connection without impacting performance

**Findings**:
- Use `db.DB()` to get underlying sql.DB
- Call `Ping()` method for connection test
- Minimal overhead, safe for frequent polling
- Already available in existing storage layer

**Application**: Leverage existing database connection in storage package

### Integration with Existing Codebase
**Research**: How to integrate with current Gin routing and handlers

**Findings**:
- Current health endpoint at `/health` returns simple JSON
- Can enhance in-place without breaking changes
- Use existing middleware stack (CORS, logging, security)
- Follow existing handler patterns

**Application**: Enhance existing health handler in main.go

## Conclusions

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items resolved:
1. ✅ System information: Include version and timestamp
2. ✅ External dependencies: Database only for now
3. ✅ Error codes: Standard HTTP codes (200/503/500)

**Next Phase**: Proceed to Phase 1 design and contracts
