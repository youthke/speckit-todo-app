# Feature Specification: API Health Endpoint

**Feature Branch**: `002-api-health`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "api/health„ÇíÂÆüË£Ö„Åó„Å¶"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator or monitoring service, I want to check the health status of the TODO application API so that I can verify the service is running correctly and detect any issues before they affect users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the TODO application is running normally, **When** I request the health endpoint, **Then** I receive a successful response indicating the service is healthy
2. **Given** the TODO application database is connected, **When** I request the health endpoint, **Then** the response includes database connectivity status
3. **Given** I am a monitoring service, **When** I poll the health endpoint regularly, **Then** I can detect service outages and respond appropriately
4. **Given** the health endpoint is called, **When** the response is returned, **Then** it includes a timestamp of when the check was performed
5. **Given** the service is experiencing issues, **When** I request the health endpoint, **Then** I receive an appropriate error status and diagnostic information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the database connection is lost but the web server is still running?
- How does the health check behave when the service is starting up or shutting down?
- What information should be included when the service is degraded but not completely down?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a health check endpoint that returns the current service status
- **FR-002**: Health endpoint MUST respond with HTTP 200 when all systems are operational
- **FR-003**: Health endpoint MUST include service status information in a structured format
- **FR-004**: Health endpoint MUST check database connectivity as part of health verification
- **FR-005**: Health endpoint MUST respond within a reasonable timeframe for monitoring purposes
- **FR-006**: Health endpoint MUST include a timestamp indicating when the health check was performed
- **FR-007**: Health endpoint MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes for different health states
- **FR-008**: Health endpoint MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should detailed system information like version, uptime be included?]
- **FR-009**: Health endpoint MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it check external dependencies beyond database?]
- **FR-010**: Health endpoint MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific error codes should be returned for different failure scenarios?]

### Key Entities
- **Health Status**: Represents the current operational state of the service, including overall status, database connectivity, timestamp, and any relevant diagnostic information
- **Health Check Response**: Contains structured information about service health that can be consumed by monitoring systems and administrators
