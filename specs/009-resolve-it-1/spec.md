# Feature Specification: Import Path Cleanup

**Feature Branch**: `009-resolve-it-1`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "resolve it, 1. Import path inconsistencies:
    - services/auth/oauth.go references undefined models
    - internal/config/database.go references undefined legacymodels
    - These prevent full backend compilation
    - Resolution: Separate cleanup task needed"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: Should legacy models be migrated to the current models package or maintained separately? ‚Üí A: Deprecate legacy models and remove all references to them
- Q: Are there other files beyond oauth.go and database.go with similar import issues? ‚Üí A: Unknown, need to scan codebase first
- Q: What is the desired final package structure for models? ‚Üí A: DDD

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the todo-app codebase, I need the backend to compile successfully so that I can build, test, and deploy the application without errors. Currently, broken import paths prevent compilation, blocking all development and deployment activities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the backend codebase with unknown import issues, **When** I perform a codebase scan, **Then** all files with undefined import references are identified and reported
2. **Given** the backend codebase with broken import paths, **When** I run the build command after fixes, **Then** the compilation completes successfully without import-related errors
3. **Given** all import paths have been corrected, **When** I run the test suite, **Then** all tests can execute without import resolution failures
4. **Given** the codebase is ready for deployment, **When** the CI/CD pipeline runs, **Then** the build step succeeds and produces deployable artifacts

### Edge Cases
- What happens when circular dependencies exist between the corrected import paths?
- How does the system handle cases where multiple files reference the same undefined import?
- What if some imports are conditionally used and not immediately obvious during static analysis?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all files in the codebase with undefined import references through automated scanning
- **FR-002**: System MUST successfully compile the backend without import path errors
- **FR-003**: System MUST resolve all references to undefined models in services/auth/oauth.go
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove all references to legacy models in internal/config/database.go and deprecate the legacy models package entirely
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize models following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles
- **FR-006**: System MUST resolve import issues in any additional files discovered during codebase scanning
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain existing functionality after import paths are corrected
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure all package references point to existing, accessible modules
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve backward compatibility for any public APIs that depend on the corrected imports
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable successful execution of the full test suite after import corrections

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Import Path**: References to code modules that need to be valid and resolvable during compilation
- **Domain Model Package**: Contains data model definitions organized by domain context following DDD principles
- **Legacy Models Package**: Historical model definitions to be deprecated and removed from the codebase
