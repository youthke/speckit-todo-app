# Research: TODO App Implementation

## Go Backend Framework Decision

**Decision**: Gin web framework
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and fast HTTP router
- Excellent performance for REST APIs
- Strong middleware ecosystem
- Simple integration with Go's standard library
- Clear documentation and active community

**Alternatives considered**:
- Echo: Similar performance, but Gin has broader adoption
- net/http standard library: Too low-level for this scope
- Fiber: Good performance but smaller ecosystem

## React Frontend Architecture

**Decision**: Create React App with functional components and hooks
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard setup for React applications
- Built-in development server and build tools
- TypeScript support available if needed later
- Hooks provide clean state management for simple apps

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vite: Faster dev server but CRA is more battle-tested
- Class components: Hooks are modern standard
- Next.js: Overkill for single-page TODO app

## Database Choice

**Decision**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
**Rationale**:
- SQLite requires no setup for local development
- PostgreSQL provides production-grade features
- Both support SQL standard for easy migration
- GORM provides good Go ORM support for both

**Alternatives considered**:
- MySQL: PostgreSQL has better JSON support
- In-memory: No persistence between sessions
- JSON files: No query capabilities, poor concurrency

## API Design Pattern

**Decision**: RESTful API with JSON responses
**Rationale**:
- Standard HTTP methods map well to CRUD operations
- Simple client-server communication
- Easy to test and debug
- Widely understood by developers

**Alternatives considered**:
- GraphQL: Overkill for simple CRUD operations
- gRPC: Web browser compatibility issues
- WebSocket: Real-time not required for single user

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Test-driven development with unit and integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Go testing package provides sufficient capabilities
- Jest/React Testing Library standard for React
- Clear separation between API and UI testing
- Contract tests ensure API compatibility

**Alternatives considered**:
- E2E only: Slower feedback, harder to debug
- Unit tests only: Miss integration issues
- Manual testing: Not maintainable

## State Management

**Decision**: React useState and useEffect hooks
**Rationale**:
- Built-in React capabilities sufficient for simple app
- No external dependencies needed
- Direct and easy to understand
- Can upgrade to Context API if complexity grows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux: Overkill for simple TODO state
- Zustand: Additional dependency not justified
- Context API: Can add later if needed

## Development Workflow

**Decision**: Local backend server with React dev server
**Rationale**:
- Both can run simultaneously during development
- Hot reload for both frontend and backend changes
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Easy debugging with separate processes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Docker development: More complex setup
- Monorepo tools: Not needed for simple structure
- Backend proxy through React: Less flexible

## Key Dependencies Summary

**Backend (Go)**:
- `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` - HTTP router
- `gorm.io/gorm` - ORM for database operations
- `gorm.io/driver/sqlite` - SQLite driver
- `github.com/stretchr/testify` - Testing utilities

**Frontend (React)**:
- `react` and `react-dom` - Core React libraries
- `@testing-library/react` - Component testing
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - Testing utilities
- `axios` - HTTP client for API calls

## Research Completion Status

All technical decisions documented with clear rationale. No remaining unknowns that would block Phase 1 design work.
