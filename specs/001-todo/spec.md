# Feature Specification: TODO App

**Feature Branch**: `001-todo`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "TODO„Ç¢„Éó„É™„Çí‰Ωú„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ„ÄÇ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage my personal tasks in a digital TODO list so that I can track what needs to be done, mark items as complete, and stay organized.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have an empty TODO list, **When** I add a new task with a title, **Then** the task appears in my list
2. **Given** I have tasks in my list, **When** I mark a task as completed, **Then** the task status changes to show it's done
3. **Given** I have tasks in my list, **When** I edit a task title, **Then** the updated title is saved and displayed
4. **Given** I have completed and uncompleted tasks, **When** I view my list, **Then** I can see the status of each task clearly
5. **Given** I have tasks I no longer need, **When** I delete a task, **Then** it is permanently removed from my list

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add a task with no title?
- How does the system handle very long task titles?
- What happens if a user tries to delete all tasks at once?
- How should the system behave when there are no tasks to display?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new tasks with a title
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to mark tasks as completed/uncompleted
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to edit existing task titles
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to delete tasks
- **FR-005**: System MUST display all tasks with their current status (completed/pending)
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist tasks so they remain available between sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent creation of tasks with empty titles
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual distinction between completed and pending tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user authentication required? Single user or multi-user system?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data export/import capabilities needed?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: task categorization or priority levels required?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: due dates or scheduling features needed?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Represents a single item to be done, with attributes including title, completion status, creation date, and modification date
- **Task List**: Collection of tasks belonging to a user, maintains order and provides filtering capabilities
